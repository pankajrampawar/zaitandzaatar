                Details="The gyro is a classic Mediterranean dish featuring seasoned, slow-cooked meat- thinly sliced and served in a warm pita bread. Topped with fresh vegetables like lettuce, tomatoes, and onions, and drizzled with creamy tzatziki sauce, itâ€™s a delicious blend of flavors and textures. Perfect for a quick lunch, dinner, or satisfying snack. Our gyro is crafted fresh daily to deliver authentic Mediterranean taste in every bite."
