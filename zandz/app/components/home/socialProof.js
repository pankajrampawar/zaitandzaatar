                        review="I have been wanting falafel for a long time, found this place while cruising through St Paul. I got 5 orders for my family to share. Sooooo yummy. Crispy, not too greasy at all, perfect flavor. I couldâ€™ve eaten 50 of them. Tahini sauce was delicious. This was during the virus thing so had to do a quick stop, but would love to go there again when we have more time. Cute place with middle eastern flavor."

They offer samples of the unique beverages (teas and juice drinks). They really aim to please. I had the Sampler Plate as my dinner and it was a great amount of food. Definitely coming back again!"
